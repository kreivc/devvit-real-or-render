# Requirements Document

## Introduction

Real or Render is a daily challenge game built on Reddit's Devvit platform where players test their ability to distinguish between real photographs and AI-generated images. Each day presents a unique set of 10 image pairs, and players compete on a daily leaderboard based on accuracy and speed. The game features image prefetching for instant gameplay, real-time timer tracking, score calculation, and persistent leaderboards using Redis.

4. WHEN a round is displayed THEN the system SHALL show two images side by side
5. WHEN a round is displayed THEN the system SHALL show the question "Which image is REAL?"
6. WHEN a round is displayed THEN the system SHALL show the instruction "Click on the photograph (not the AI-generated image)"
7. WHEN the user clicks an image THEN the system SHALL record whether the answer is correct or incorrect
8. WHEN the user clicks an image THEN the system SHALL immediately advance to the next round
9. WHEN displaying game progress THEN the system SHALL show "Correct: X" and "Incorrect: X" counters at the bottom
10. WHEN all 10 rounds are completed THEN the system SHALL stop the timer

### Requirement 5: Game Data Structure

3. WHEN using game data THEN the system SHALL use the "real" field for the real image URL
4. WHEN using game data THEN the system SHALL use the "render" field for the AI-generated image URL
5. WHEN using game data THEN the system SHALL use the "source" field for attribution in the results screen

### Requirement 6: Results Screen

**User Story:** As a player, I want to see my game results after completing all rounds, so that I know how well I performed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

2. WHEN showing results THEN the system SHALL display the current date in YYYY-MM-DD format
3. WHEN showing results THEN the system SHALL display the number of correct answers in green
4. WHEN showing results THEN the system SHALL display the number of incorrect answers in red
5. WHEN showing results THEN the system SHALL display the total time taken in MM:SS format
6. WHEN showing results THEN the system SHALL display the score as "X / 10"
7. WHEN showing results THEN the system SHALL display current ranking
8. WHEN showing results THEN the system SHALL display a "Share Results ðŸŽ‰" button

2. WHEN the score is calculated THEN the system SHALL call an internal API endpoint to save the score
3. WHEN saving the score THEN the system SHALL only save if this is the user's first play of the day
4. WHEN saving to Redis THEN the system SHALL use the command: ZADD leaderboard:daily:YYYY-MM-DD score userId

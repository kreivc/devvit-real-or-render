# Implementation Plan

## Overview

This implementation plan transforms the Real or Render game design into actionable coding tasks. The game is built on Reddit's Devvit platform using React for the client and Express for the server, with Redis for data persistence. Tasks are organized to build incrementally, starting with core data structures and progressing through each game screen to the final leaderboard integration.

## Current Status

The project has basic scaffolding in place:
- ‚úÖ Basic Devvit project structure with client/server/shared folders
- ‚úÖ Express server setup with router configuration
- ‚úÖ React client with Vite build system
- ‚úÖ Basic DailyGameData type defined in shared types
- ‚è≥ No game components or API endpoints implemented yet

## Notes

- Tasks marked with `*` are optional enhancements that improve code organization but are not required for core functionality
- All API endpoints must start with `/api/` per Devvit platform requirements
- Redis keys follow the pattern: `leaderboard:daily:YYYY-MM-DD` and `player:${userId}:YYYY-MM-DD`
- Score formula prioritizes accuracy: (Correct √ó 1,000,000) + Time(ms)
- Only the first daily play counts toward the leaderboard
- All images must be prefetched before gameplay starts for instant loading
